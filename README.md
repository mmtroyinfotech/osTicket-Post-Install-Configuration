The Admin Panel can be incredibly useful in managing and organizing your team effectively. Hereâ€™s a bit more detail:

Create Roles and Departments: You can define specific roles (like Admin, Supervisor, Agent) and departments (like Sales, Support, IT) based on your needs.

Assign Agents: Easily allocate agents to their respective roles and departments, ensuring everyone knows their responsibilities.

Agent Privileges: Customize the permissions and access levels for different agents. This allows you to control what each agent can do and see within the system, enhancing security and efficiency.

It's a robust tool to streamline operations and ensure smooth workflow. If you need tips or examples on how to best utilize this feature, just let me know!
